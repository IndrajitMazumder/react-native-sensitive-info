RNSInfo is an open-source library developed by many contributors since 2016. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Securing sensitive data is very important in production-ready applications. So, this is why RNSInfo was created for, to help you focus in what matters most, your application. üòâ

Handling sensitive data couldn't be easier in React-Native apps. 

## v6.x

Below you can find the new incoming features from v6.x

### BREAKING CHANGES:

* This version uses by default **keystore to encrypt/decrypt data** on Android. So, if you use the **master branch** or **v5.x** in your project you may not be able to retrieve previous saved data. We still need more work to handle this. The discussion can be found [here](https://github.com/mCodex/react-native-sensitive-info/issues/196). On the other hand, if you already use keystore branch you can give it a try.

* The method `isHardwareDetected` was removed due to `isSensorAvailable`

### More changes

- [x] Finally added keystore to encrypt/decrypt data before saving/retrieving in sharedPreferences üéâ
- [x] Migrating JS code to TS
- [x] Added Android's  Biometric Prompt for supported devices
- [x] **If you were using keystore's branch:** Added many bug fixes and improvements which were available only in master's branch


## Demo

```js
import SInfo from 'react-native-sensitive-info';

const savingFirstData = await SInfo.setItem('key1', 'value1', {
    sharedPreferencesName: 'mySharedPrefs',
    keychainService: 'myKeychain'
});

console.log(savingFirstData) //value1

// Need to retrieve later?

const gettingFirstData = await SInfo.getItem('key1', {
    sharedPreferencesName: 'mySharedPrefs',
    keychainService: 'myKeychain'
});

console.log(gettingFirstData) //value1

//Need to get all values stored?

const gettingAllKeys = await SInfo.getAllItems({
    sharedPreferencesName: 'mySharedPrefs',
    keychainService: 'myKeychain'}
);

console.log(gettingAllKeys) //value1
